Ruby project

Thank you all for coming, yes is my first project in coding. 
bear in mind that something are not fully seated, they are
just there as placeholders. 

Any input would be apriciated, self teaching and all.

firstly this is just a terminal program, there is nothing 
tying this code to html, this is something i need to learn.
